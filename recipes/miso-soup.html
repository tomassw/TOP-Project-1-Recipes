    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This miso soup is full of savory flavors. Add more dashi to your soup if you want a stronger stock. You can use yellow, 
        white, or red miso paste for this soup â€” yellow miso is sweet and creamy, red miso is stronger and saltier.
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 cups water</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons miso paste</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons dashi granules</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) package silken tofu, diced</li>
        <li>2 green onions, sliced diagonally into 1/2 inch pieces</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine water and dashi granules in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat; bring to a boil. 
            Reduce heat to medium and whisk in miso paste. Stir in tofu. 
            Separate the layers of green onions, and add them to the soup. Simmer gently for 2 to 3 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Tips</h3>
    <p>
        Dashi is a basic stock used in Japanese cooking which is made by boiling dried kelp (seaweed) and dried bonito (fish). 
        Instant dashi granules are sold in conveniently-sized jars or packets and vary in strength.
